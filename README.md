# Simulating chemical systems on a quantum computer

This is a repository for code to simulate Quantum beats (Dynamic singletâ€“triplet transitions) in spin-correlated radical pairs
on a quantum computer. We are going to use Riggeti Forest and IBM Q as our platforms.
Modeling quantum beats might be one of the applications where quantum supremacy can be demonstrated.

This effect was discovered and experimentally confirmed by Russian scientists V A Bagryansky, V I Borovkov and Yu N Molin in 2007.
